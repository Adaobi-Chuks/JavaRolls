# JavaRolls
JavaRolls is a game where the player rolls a dice and can only win if certain criterias are met. This was created to test my Java coding skills so far.

Rules of the game:
The player gets one point if 1 is rolled.
The player gets one point if 2 is rolled.
The player gets one point if 3 is rolled.
The player gets zero point if 4 is rolled.
The player gets one point if 5 is rolled.
The game ends if 6 is rolled.

For the player to win when the game ends, at least three points have to be collected before the end of the game.
